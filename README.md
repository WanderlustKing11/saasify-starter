# Saasify-Starter

A scalable SaaS application template built with Next.js, designed to learn best practices for building and expanding revenue-generating web services.

---

## Tech Stack

- **Next.js**: Web framework with support for PostCSS, Tailwind CSS, ESLint, and a `src` directory structure.
- **Styling**: Shadcn and Tailwind UI for CSS and component design.
- **Payments**: Stripe for handling billing, payments, and SaaS integrations.
- **Authentication**: Clerk for secure user authentication.
- **Database**: Neon with PostgreSQL, using Drizzle as the ORM.

## Project Status

This project is currently a work-in-progress. The goal is to create a flexible SaaS template that can be adapted for future large-scale applications.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Ensure you have the following installed:

- **Node.js** (recommended version: 14.x or newer)
- **Git** for cloning the repository
- **Stripe Account** for payment and billing integration
- **Clerk Account** for authentication
- **Neon Database** setup with PostgreSQL and Drizzle ORM access

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository**:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/Saasify-Starter.git
   cd Saasify-Starter
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. **Set up environment variables**:

   Create a `.env.local` file in the root directory of the project and add the following variables. Replace the placeholders with your actual credentials and configuration details.

   ```plaintext
   # Stripe
   STRIPE_API_KEY=your_stripe_api_key

   # Clerk
   CLERK_API_KEY=your_clerk_api_key

   # Database (Neon with Drizzle and PostgreSQL)
   DATABASE_URL=your_database_url
   ```

4. **Initialize the database** (if necessary):

   This may include running initial migration files or seeding data as needed. Run the following command if migrations are available in the project:

   ```bash
   npx drizzle-kit db push
   ```

5. **Start the development server**:

   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

   The application will be available at [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).

### Deployment

Detailed deployment instructions will be added soon, but generally, youâ€™ll need to configure hosting on a platform like Vercel or similar and link your environment variables for production.
